\sectionHeading{Profile}

I've been using PHP for almost as long as it's existed
and have carried my OOP skills over from nearly 30 years
of use into other languages.
In the last few years working with MVC frameworks (mostly Symfony)
but also working with "Plain PHP", Python and Ruby on Rails.

I can write complex, optimised and readable SQL queries in raw SQL as well
as using ORMs (I like to think I know Doctrine literally inside-out).

But I'm also more than familiar with the client-side. I've been using JavaScript
since the "bad old days" of "the browser war" through "the age of jQuery" and
am now more than competent with VueJS. I've watched HTML/CSS grow and have used
Bootstrap extensively although with the more modern CSS options like Flexbox
and Grids I haven't touched Bootstrap for ages.

I've not got a degree but I feel that my 35-odd years of experience in a wide
range of roles more than makes up for this.

    for keeping track of which users were currently logged in
